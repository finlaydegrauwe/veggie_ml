Dutch website & ML model!
Take a look here: .netlify.app

Veggie is a machine learning model that has been trained with a database of only a couple of vegetables: beetroot, bell pepper, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, corn, cucumber, eggplant, ginger and potatoes.

The website built around it allows it to be used based upon Pix2pix = draw something and the model will generate a vegetable out of your drawing.
Once you're satisfied with the generated vegetable, you can give it a name or let the name generator do that for you. 
Then you can save it, or look around the database of vegetables made by others where you can pick some of them to throw them in a smoothie.

Smoothie is the model taking the generated vegetables to then run it through the model once more, which often has a weird mix of soup as outcome, hence the name smoothie.

Enjoy Veggie!
